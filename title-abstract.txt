Title:
Bridging the Gap: Solving Music Disputes with Recommendation Systems

Abstract:
Many have probably found themselves in an uncomfortable conversation in which a parent is questioning why the song playing 
over a bedroom speaker is so loud, repetitive, or profane. If someone has never had such a conversation, at the very least 
they have probably made a conscious decision to refrain from playing a certain genre or artist when their parents are around. 
Knowing what music to play in these situations does not have to be an elaborate, stressful process. In fact, finding appropriate 
songs can be made quite simple with the help of recommendation systems.

Our solution to this issue actually consists of two recommendation systems that function in similar ways. The first takes music 
that parents enjoy and recommends it to their children. The second takes music that children enjoy and recommends it to their 
parents. Both these recommendation systems create their own individual Spotify playlists that try to “bridge the gap” between 
the music tastes of parents and their children. Through user testing and user interviews we found that our recommenders had mixed 
success in creating playlists that could be listened to by children and their parents. The success of our recommendations seemed 
to be largely correlated with the degree of inherent similarity between the music tastes of children and their parents. So while 
our solution is not perfect, in situations where overlap between parents and children exist, our recommender can successfully 
“bridge the gap”.
